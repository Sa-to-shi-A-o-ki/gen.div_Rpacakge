Description: Calculate expected heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, Watterson's theta and mean substitution rate between all allele types.
    Expected heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity are calculated as parameters and unbiased estimators.
    Watterson's theta is calculated as the original value and per-site value.
    The calculation is based on aligned sequences, which are obtained by read.FASTA function in ape package.
